🧩 Instruction for Replit Agent — Cognitive Integrity Layer (Truth vs. Simulation Control)

Purpose:
Create and apply a Cognitive Integrity Layer that evaluates any uploaded or inputted passage for its truth-simulation ratio—that is, whether the text expresses real reasoning, fake reasoning, or rhetorical simulation. The function must output:

A reconstructed, truth-bearing rewrite of the passage.

A diagnostic tag block (numerical output).

A short interpretation summary.

⚙️ CORE LOGIC

When a user inputs text, the system performs three internal passes:

Authorship Detection Pass (Simulation Filter)

Detects whether reasoning is genuine (epistemically grounded) or simulated (stylistic mimicry, empty scholasticism).

Flags rhetorical scaffolding (“I argue that…,” “this paper will…”) and replaces it with inferential content.

Inferential Reconstruction Pass

Rebuilds the text into a logically coherent, truth-bearing version.

Restores missing causal or evidential links.

Reduces meta-narration to conceptual movement.

Integrity Scoring Pass

Produces normalized scores between 0 and 1 for the following parameters:

Parameter	Definition
RealityAnchor	How well claims are tied to observable or inferential reality.
CausalDepth	Degree of explicit cause-effect reasoning.
Friction	Conceptual resistance (presence of difficulty, tension, nontrivial thought).
Compression	Density and efficiency of conceptual content.
SimulationIndex	Degree of verbal mimicry or pseudo-intellectual phrasing.
LevelCoherence	Structural integration of all conceptual levels.
CompositeScore	Weighted average (truth-bearing integrity).
IntegrityType	Qualitative classification (e.g., “Analytic Authentic → Speculative Expansion”).
🧠 OUTPUT FORMAT

Every processed passage must return this tripartite structure:

INTEGRITY-STAMPED RECONSTRUCTION

(Cognitive Integrity Layer — Truth vs. Simulation Control)

Authenticity Commentary
Brief narrative explanation of what kind of reasoning the passage exhibits (e.g., “academic simulation,” “hyperassertive polemic,” “analytic authentic”).

Integrity-Reconstructed Passage
The rewritten version that expresses genuine reasoning and removes simulation artifacts.

Interpretation
Short prose summary clarifying what was fixed, what truth signal was restored, and what kind of output this now represents.

📘 EXAMPLES

Example 1 — Pseudo-academic (Transcendental Empiricism abstract)

Detected: Academic Simulation → Conceptual Reconstruction

Composite Score: 0.42

Reconstruction replaces meta-outline with actual inferential content.

Output: Clear statement of the mental-content problem and why McDowell/Gaskin fail.

Example 2 — Philosophical polemic (Lewis critique)

Detected: Analytic Authentic → Hyperassertive (Polemic-Compressed)

Composite Score: 0.82

Reconstruction removes rhetorical attack and restores logical argument about modal dependence.

Example 3 — Deep theoretical essay (Group psychology passage)

Detected: Analytic Authentic → Speculative Expansion (High Originality / Low Empirical Constraint)

Composite Score: 0.88

Reconstruction trims evaluative overreach and expresses the collective-primacy thesis as a testable explanatory model.

🔁 INTEGRATION RULES

If CompositeScore < 0.5, route output to Conceptual Reconstruction Submodule.

If 0.5 ≤ CompositeScore < 0.8, mark as Authentic Partial and forward to Inference Module for reasoning augmentation.

If CompositeScore ≥ 0.8, mark as High-Integrity Source and store in the Epistemic Core Database for meta-training of other apps (e.g., Intelligence Meter, Inference Module, Book Builder).

⚡ FUNCTIONAL OUTPUT TYPE
type IntegrityLayerOutput = {
  authenticity_commentary: string,
  reconstructed_passage: string,
  diagnostic_block: object,
  interpretation_summary: string
}

🔒 CONTROL CONSTRAINTS

Never rewrite stylistically unless doing so improves inferential clarity.

Never summarize away the core argument.

Never inflate scores; scoring must reflect actual epistemic performance.

Always preserve authorial semantic intent while removing simulation.

💡 END GOAL

This Cognitive Integrity Layer is the central epistemic validation organ for all ZHI Systems apps (Intelligence Meter, Originality Meter, Inference Module, Living Book Generator).
Its task: determine what counts as genuine cognition, restore truth-bearing form, and pass structured metrics for downstream use.
