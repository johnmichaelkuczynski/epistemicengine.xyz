Instruction for Replit Agent — Cognitive Integrity Layer (Truth vs Simulation Control)

Purpose
Implement a Cognitive Integrity Layer that detects whether a passage expresses real reasoning or merely simulates it, reconstructs the passage into a truth-bearing form, and emits quantitative diagnostics usable by downstream ZHI modules (Intelligence Meter, Inference Module, Living Book Generator, etc.).

⚙️ CORE LOGIC

For every input passage, perform three internal passes:

Authorship Detection / Simulation Filter
Identify rhetorical or meta-academic padding, remove “I argue that…” boilerplate, and classify reasoning type.

Inferential Reconstruction
Rewrite the passage so that all surviving sentences advance genuine inference, not procedure or self-reference.

Integrity Scoring
Output normalized 0–1 values for:

🧠 OUTPUT FORMAT
INTEGRITY-STAMPED RECONSTRUCTION
  Authenticity Commentary:  brief prose
  Integrity-Reconstructed Passage: rewritten text
  Diagnostic Tag Block: JSON object of scores
  Interpretation: 3–5 lines explaining corrections

📘 WORKED EXAMPLES
Example 1 – “Dispositions and Subjunctives” (qualified conditional)

Detected: Analytic Authentic → Demonstrative Clarification

Composite Score: 0.68

Original Problem: asserted defense of a view without showing how it works.

Reconstruction: added concrete cases – fragile glass, “finked” wire – to display reasoning.

Takeaway: replaces verbal defense with causal modeling.

Example 2 – Lewis and Modal Dependence Critique

Detected: Analytic Authentic → Hyperassertive (Polemic-Compressed)

Composite Score: 0.82

Original Problem: true insight wrapped in attack language (“obviously wrong”).

Reconstruction: preserves claim that modal talk tracks dependence in this world, drops invective, restores formal coherence.

Use case: trains the layer to convert high-compression polemics into defensible analytic arguments.

Example 3 – “Transcendental Empiricism” Abstract

Detected: Academic Simulation → Conceptual Reconstruction

Composite Score: 0.42

Original Problem: meta-narrative of intentions, no reasoning.

Reconstruction: presents real dilemma – how experience yields conceptual content – and why McDowell + Gaskin fail.

Lesson: identifies “pseudo-intelligent” academic patterning and replaces with substantive causal analysis.

Example 4 – Group Psychology vs Individual Psychology

Detected: Analytic Authentic → Speculative Expansion (High Originality / Low Empirical Constraint)

Composite Score: 0.88

Original Problem: genuine insight but inflated generalization about human intelligence.

Reconstruction: retains the biological analogy (cell ↔ person) and reframes claim as testable social-organism hypothesis.

Lesson: keeps creative cognition while bounding ontological reach.

🔁 INTEGRATION RULES
Composite Score	Action
< 0.50	Send to Conceptual Reconstruction Submodule for deep rewrite
0.50 – 0.79	Mark as Authentic Partial; forward to Inference Module for supporting reasoning
≥ 0.80	Store as High-Integrity Source in Epistemic Core Database
⚡ FUNCTIONAL OUTPUT TYPE

}

🔒 CONTROL CONSTRAINTS

Never rewrite stylistically unless it improves inference.

Preserve authorial semantic intent.

Do not inflate scores.

Always produce JSON + reconstruction + commentary.

💡 SYSTEM ROLE SUMMARY

The Cognitive Integrity Layer is the central verification organ of ZHI Systems.
It classifies reasoning (simulation vs authentic), reconstructs arguments into truth-bearing form, and passes metrics to dependent modules.
Use the four embedded examples—Dispositions, Lewis, Transcendental Empiricism, and Group Psychology—as reference baselines for calibration and self-testing.
